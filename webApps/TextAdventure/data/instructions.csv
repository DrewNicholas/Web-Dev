You have taken the left door. Now there is a knife and a cake set on the table before you. Which do you choose?
You have taken the door on the right. Now there is a dog and a cat in the room. Which do you choose to pet?
You chose the knife. Congratulations! You have been contracted by the Constructive Socialist party to take out Donald Trump. Feel the Bern!
You chose the cake. The cake is a lie! Just kidding, it's gluten free and vegan so you probably don't want to eat it anyway.
You pet the dog. Congratulation! You have a companion for life and a way around eating your mom's fruitcake next Christmas!
You pet the cat. You now have an apathetic creature shedding throughout your house. It's like a teenager who will not pay for your retirement later in life.
